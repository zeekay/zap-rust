# Installation

## Prerequisites

You need the ZAP compiler (`zap`) installed on your system. This compiles `.zap` schema files into a binary format that the Rust code generator reads.

### macOS

```bash
brew install zap
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
apt-get install zap
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zap-protocol/zap.git
cd zap/c++
autoreconf -i
./configure
make -j6
sudo make install
```

Verify installation:

```bash
zap --version
```

## Rust Crates

Add the runtime crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
zap = "0.25"
```

Add the code generator as a build dependency:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
zapc = "0.25"
```

### Optional Crates

For async I/O:

```toml
[dependencies]
zap-futures = "0.25"
```

For RPC:

```toml
[dependencies]
zap-rpc = "0.25"
```

## Feature Flags

The `zap` crate supports several feature flags:

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `std` | Yes | Standard library support |
| `alloc` | Yes | Heap allocation |
| `unaligned` | No | Relaxed alignment (slower on some targets) |
| `sync_reader` | No | Thread-safe message readers |

### no_std Support

For embedded systems:

```toml
[dependencies]
zap = { version = "0.25", default-features = false }
```

With allocation but no std:

```toml
[dependencies]
zap = { version = "0.25", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }
```

## Project Structure

A typical project layout:

```
my-project/
  Cargo.toml
  build.rs          # Code generation
  src/
    lib.rs
    schema.zap    # Your schema
```

The `build.rs` file compiles schemas at build time:

```rust
fn main() {
    zap::CompilerCommand::new()
        .file("src/schema.zap")
        .run()
        .expect("schema compiler command");
}
```

Include the generated code in your source:

```rust
zap::generated_code!(mod schema_zap);
```
