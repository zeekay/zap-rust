description: ZAP Rust - zero-copy serialization and capability-based RPC
---

# ZAP Rust

ZAP is a type system for distributed systems. With ZAP, you describe your data and interfaces in a schema file, then generate code to produce and consume values of those types.

## Why ZAP?

ZAP messages are encoded in a format suitable for:

- **Network transmission** - efficient wire format
- **Disk persistence** - directly mmap files
- **Zero-copy traversal** - skip serialization entirely

This means ZAP is "infinity times faster" than alternatives like Protocol Buffers - you can completely skip the deserialization step.

## Rust Implementation

The Rust implementation provides:

- **Type-safe builders and readers** with lifetime tracking
- **Capability-based RPC** with object references
- **Async support** via futures and tokio
- **no_std support** for embedded systems

## Crates

| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `capnp` | Runtime library for ZAP messages |
| `capnpc` | Code generator plugin for build.rs |
| `capnp-futures` | Async reading and writing |
| `capnp-rpc` | Object-capability RPC system |

## Example Schema

```capnp
@0x986b3393db1396c9;

struct Point {
    x @0 :Float32;
    y @1 :Float32;
}

interface PointTracker {
    addPoint @0 (p :Point) -> (totalPoints :UInt64);
}
```

The generated Rust code includes:
- `point::Reader<'a>` with `get_x()` and `get_y()` methods
- `point::Builder<'a>` with `set_x()` and `set_y()` methods
- `point_tracker::Server` trait with `add_point()` method
- `point_tracker::Client` for remote invocation

The lifetime parameter `'a` tracks borrowed references to the underlying message buffers - no copying occurs.
